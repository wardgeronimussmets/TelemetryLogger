ession History Packet

This packet contains lap times and tyre usage for the session. This packet works slightly differently to other packets. To reduce CPU and bandwidth, each packet relates to a specific vehicle and is sent every 1/20 s, and the vehicle being sent is cycled through. Therefore in a 20 car race you should receive an update for each vehicle at least once per second.

Note that at the end of the race, after the final classification packet has been sent, a final bulk update of all the session histories for the vehicles in that session will be sent.
